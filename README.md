### What is segmentation?.
Segmentation means dividing a large group of people (like customers) into smaller groups based on things they have in common. This helps businesses understand them better and offer products, services, or             messages that match their needs.
### Types :
  - Demographic Segmentation

  - Psychographic Segmentation
  - Behavioral Segmentation

### RFM Segmentation.
  
RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary—a data-driven customer segmentation technique used to analyze and rank customers based on their purchasing behavior. Here’s a breakdown of the three components:

  - Recency (R): Measures how recently a customer made a purchase.
  - Frequency (F): Measures how often a customer makes purchases within a specific period.
  - Monetary (M): Measures how much money a customer has spent in total.
